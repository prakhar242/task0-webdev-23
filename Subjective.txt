Which came first , the chicken or the egg ? This topic has been the basis of endless debates which till this date have not been able to solve the mystery except proposing various theories as to how this event might have turned out back in the day. 
To point at a particular solution might seem baseless as there are no concrete evidence as to support it . The world has evovled  so have the humans and a large number of other species of the existing eco-system in an effort to sustain themselves in this ever changing climatic conditions on the blue planet. The whole universe has a story ,  wecan trace back its existence but going back has got no limits as we can propose that it might have been x which led to the result of y .The question now looms large as to how x came about.
The same goes around with this chicken story as well . There have definitely been a lot of mutations that the species have observed since it came into existence (which can be answered only by thee almighty on which still people raise fingers if god exists or not). To address the problem , the theory most widely accepted is:
  
 It was neither actually a chicken nor an egg but some other species of birds which came close to chicken, fertilized the egg and over decades of mutaations and evolutions it finally led to the chicken that we see.These birds which have been refered to are known as proto-hen and the proto-rooster which actually fertilized the egg leading to the hatching of chickens i.e. the child was different from the parents the reason for which is addressed by the changing gene structure over centuries.
 
So I reckon if nott chicken ,  the species was one that closely or rather to some extent resembled chicken.

I think the eggs came first because before millions of years animal and plant kingdom 
evolved by means of genetic growth and mutuation...so even the chicken animal would have 
come from some animal or the other through evolution.By this way the 1st chicken would
have come from egg...but the pure chicken egg would have come from chicken. so the point 
is chicken would have not come without eggs...so EGGS CAME FIRST.

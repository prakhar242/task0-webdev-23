Due to genetic mutation and evolution the so called proto-chicken(chicken like bird . it was genetically close to a chicken )
so when the male and the female proto-chicken mate, the genes combined in such a way creating mutation that made the baby different from parents.
thus a proto chicken egg gave birth to chicken.

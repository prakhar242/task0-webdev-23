The species tht we consider chicken should have evolved from another species which was very similar to a chicken but not exactly a chicken.
over a course of many years the other species must have evolved to the chicken. this evolutioon takes hundreds of years. Therefore the species
itself cannot evolve into a chicken during its lifetime because of the fact that the lifetime of it is only a few years which is not enough for 
it to evolve and its physically impossible to change the gene structure of the species as there was no advanced technology at that time. You may 
say that there might be an external factor such as radiation but that is highly unlinkely to happen. So egg should be the first one to come and 
the parents of the offspring chicken are from the species very similar to chicken. There's also a posibility of crossbreeding between different 
similar species to obtain the chicken egg.
